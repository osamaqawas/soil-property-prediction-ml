🌍 Quantitative Determination of Soil Properties Using Machine Learning and Hyperspectral Data
Author: Osama Alqawasmeh
Institution: Yarmouk University, Jordan
Project: Hyperspectral-Based Soil Contamination Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project develops machine learning models to predict soil contamination indicators—specifically Iron (Fe)—using a combination of:

Hyperspectral data (ASD spectroradiometer, EnMAP/Sentinel-2)

Environmental parameters (pH, slope, elevation, carbonate, OM, clay, NDVI, etc.)

XRF geochemical oxides (SiO₂, Al₂O₃, Fe₂O₃, CaO, MgO)

Topographic & proximity variables (distance to water, distance to roads/stations)

The goal is to integrate remote sensing, field measurements, and machine learning to build a robust prediction model for soil contamination across complex environments, including mountainous and variable terrain.

🎯 Research Objective

Develop a reproducible machine learning pipeline for:

Predicting soil Fe concentrations

Evaluating environmental and spectral controls

Identifying key variables using feature importance

Testing the generalization performance through cross-validation

Supporting soil contamination analysis along river systems in Jordan

🧠 Machine Learning Model

This repository includes a complete, ready-to-run implementation of the XGBoost Regressor, one of the most powerful gradient-boosting algorithms.

The model performs:

Train–test split

Scaling using StandardScaler

Model training with XGBoost

Metrics evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE)

5-fold cross-validation

Feature importance ranking

Actual vs. predicted plots

📥 Data Requirements

The dataset is not included for privacy reasons.

To run the code, create a file:

data/Fe.xlsx


Your Excel file must contain the following columns:

pH

Slope

Carbonate

Clay %

OM %

Elevation

SiO2

▶️ How to Run the Code
1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the main script
python src/train_xgboost.py

3. After running, the following outputs are generated automatically:

✔ figures/feature_importance.png

✔ figures/actual_vs_predicted.png

✔ Printed model performance

✔ Cross-validation statistics

📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

The script prints:

R² Score – goodness of fit

RMSE – model prediction error

MAE – absolute prediction error

5-Fold CV results – generalization accuracy
